Professor Shane Bauman has just been appointed the dean of the Mathematics 
department by the president of the university. Being a creative professor of 
mathematics, Mr. Bauman takes a systematic approach to understanding his students' 
grade patterns. He targets a batch of students who have just completed their 2B term 
(2nd-year 2nd semester). He collects data such as their final grades, their preparation 
for the exams, some background information, etc. His goal is to analyze these datasets 
and predict the probable grades of the newcomers of the 2B term. Mr. Bauman has 
enough relevant data of the newcomers to analyze possible outcomes of the course 
grades. Analyzing Mr. Bauman's data of the past 2B students and the newcomers, your 
job is to predict the likely course grades of the newcomers of the 2B term. 
Please try to be as accurate as possible to help Mr. Bauman impress the president with 
his findings. (Tips: Attention to detail and thinking outside the box will definitely take you 
a long way). Hope you enjoy the test.
Technical Details
There are two files for this test. The train.csv file contains the data sets of students who 
have completed their 2B term. You are expected to analyze these data and implement 
your analytics on test.csv file which contains necessary data sets for newcomers of the 
2B term whose grades you will be predicting.
The following are the tasks to be done in the IPython Notebook (Google Colab)
· Read the dataset with the name train.csv available in the attachment section
